# Serenity: Mental Health Self-Assessment Platform

Serenity is a comprehensive mental wellness platform that helps users assess their mental health, connect with a supportive community, and access professional therapy services. This platform is built with a modular backend using Django, with separate apps for users, assessments, doctor (therapist) services, and forums. The platform uses JWT authentication (via Django REST Framework Simple JWT with token blacklisting) to secure API endpoints.
